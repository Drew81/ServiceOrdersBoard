#Bio:
 
   The web app is a basic CRUD( cretae, read, updtae and delete ) program. 
   Working in the rstaurant industry, information has to travel fast and efficiantly.
   The digital service orders board does just that. Replacing the dry eraseboard, this 
   application provides a home page with the user you logged in with, date and number of orders. The dashboard provides of 
   creating, updating and deleting while the orders page provides just the info and progress tracking provided by the butlers 
   upon delivery.

   I plan to buid more pages such as a details page, memos and chats which has already been implented in the structure.
