# About:

   The Service Orders Board web app CRUD (create, read, update and delete) program. 
Working in the restaurant industry, information has to travel fast and efficiantly.
The digital service orders board does just that. Replacing the dry eraseboard, this 
application provides a home page with a greeting to the user, present date and number 
of orders in the database. 

   The dashboard provides the CRUD functionality while the orders page provides service order
information and an option to update the staus of delivery.

   My next steps are to build a  details page, memos and chats which has already been implented in the structure.

Contributers welcome!
