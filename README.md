# About:

The web app is a basic CRUD (cretae, read, update and delete) program. 
Working in the restaurant industry, information has to travel fast and efficiantly.
The digital service orders board does just that. Replacing the dry eraseboard, this 
application provides a home page with a greeting to the user, present date and number of orders in the database. 
The dashboard provides the the CRUD functionality while the orders page provides just the info and 
progress tracking provided by the butlers upon delivery.

I plan to buid more pages such as a details page, memos and chats which has already been implented in the structure.

Contributers welcomed!
